In this case the order of the image and the text in (head image, about us, and contact sections) will be switched horizontally or vertically according to the size of the screen to organize the context and facilitate the viewing.

## unfixed-bugs

- I used replit.com as a draft working in this project. Then when the project was almost finished, I moved my source code and images files to codeanywhere.
  
  I faced many bugs, inconvenient notifications and heavy loading using codeanywhere.
- when I tried to log in at codeanywhere using my email address or github account it shows that Subscription expired. So instead, I used the link from Code institute.
