## Testing

- I tasted the contrast by calculating the contrast ratio of text and background color using color contrast checker [coolors](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5).

- I tested the submit and the hint for required user information details in the sign up form.

- I tested the changing font color or font weight when hover the mouse over the nav-links and the submit button in sign up form.
  
- The project is tested and worked smoothly to different screen sizes. In this case the order of the image and the text in (head image, about us, and contact sections) will be switched horizontally or vertically according to the size of the screen to organize the context and facilitate the viewing, by adding flex as a a layout.

## unfixed-bugs

- I used [Replit](https://replit.com/) as a draft for my project. Then when the project was almost finished, I moved my source codes and files to codeanywhere.

- I faced many bugs, inconvenient notifications and heavy loading using codeanywhere.

- when I tried to log in at codeanywhere using my email address or github account it shows that Subscription expired. But instead, I used the link from Code institute.
